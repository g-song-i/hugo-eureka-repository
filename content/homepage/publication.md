      - This paper studies the characteristics and effects of existing CNN techniques to accurately detect deepfake videos, and extracts feature vectors of frames using CNN.  

      - In addition, deepfake videos are detected using LSTM using extracted feature vectors.  

      - I leaned the skills such as python, ML, DL, image and video process by researching about this project.
